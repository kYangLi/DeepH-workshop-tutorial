# Tutorial for DeepH-pack Workshop 2025

A hands-on tutorial for [**DeepH-pack**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00265-6) covering environment installation, dataset preparation, model training, inference, and universal material model odyssey!

> **Note:** This tutorial utilizes a JAX-based refactoring of DeepH ([GitHub](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax)), distinct from the legacy implementation available in [our public repository](https://github.com/mzjb/DeepH-pack).
